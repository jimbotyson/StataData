# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

These tutorials assume no knowledge of Stata but do assume that you are comfortable using a computer with a modern user interface (for example Windows, MacOs, linux with Ubuntu) and that you will be ok typing commands in a console or a script.  You will also need to learn how to navigate a folder or directory tree.

## Software Requirements

### Stata Release 17 or later.

Recent versions of Stata, 17 or later are required.  You can check your version from the command line with:

```
version
```

## How to use these materials

Test all the code you see.  Some of the code is written to be added to a script and you should develop a single script for all sections since some of the later material will assume that you have run earlier example code.  Sometimes the tutorial suggests that you run a command on the console or command line and you should do so.  Don't add commands intended for the console to your script - they may cause your script to break and fail.

Code to be executed and run by you looks like this:

    type this at the console and hit return
    or add it to a script and run the script
    
Generally the tutorial will be explicit about when you should add code to a script.
