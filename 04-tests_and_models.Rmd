# Hypothesis tests

## For two categorical variables

A common procedure is to test for an association between two categorical variables. We can illustrate this procedure using a tabulation with a $\chi{}^2$ statistic.

    table sex class, expected chi2

## Exercise

Create the table with statistic and expected values as above. Should you reject the *H0* that `sex` and `class` are not associated?

## For one continuous and one categorical variable of two levels

If we have one continuous numeric variable and one two level categorical variable (such as sex) that would divide our data into two groups, we can ask ourselves whether the mean of the continuous variable differs for the groups (with *H0* being that they do not).

If our two groups are independent, then we must first ask if the **variance** in the data is more or less equal between groups. The null hypothesis is that the variances are equal. This is tested by the comparison of variances using Stata's `robvar` command. We can test the `maths` scores by `sex` in our data

    robvar maths, by(sex)
    
Knowing whether or not we are dealing with groups displaying (more or less) equal variance in the variable of interest, we can go on to conduct an **independent samples t-test**.  The code is

    ttest maths, by(sex)
    
(Assuming that we have interpreted the results of `robvar` to mean the variance in maths for the two groups is equal).    

## Exercise

Run the `robvar` procedure above but for the `history` and `gender` variables. What are the three **W** statistics produced? Which of them tests that the variances are equal for a comparison of means? Is there strong enough evidence in this case to reject the null hypothesis?

Use the `ttest` command to test the null hypothesis that 

$$\mu{}\ english _{\ female \ students} = \mu \ english _{\ male\ students}$$

What conclusion do you draw?

## The paired samples ttest

We can also compare the same group of subjects on two measures to see if the means differ. In this case there is no need to check the variances before conducting the test. For example we could test whether or not mean scores in English and History differ (with the null hypothesis that they do not)

    ttest english == history

Using this procedure, how do English scores compare to History scores and how do English scores compare to Mathematics scores?

## Once continuous and one categorical variable of more than two levels

We can compare the level `avxm` by `teacher`, this is to say test the null hypothesis

$$\mu{}\ avxm \ _{teacher \ one} = \mu \mu{}\ avxm \ _{teacher \ two} = \mu{}\ avxm \ _{teacher \ three} $$

### One way ANOVA and post-hoc testing

The Stata command to test the null hypothesis above is


    oneway maths teacher, bonferroni tabulate
    
This command produces summary statistics the ANOVA statistic **F**, its associated probability, and other quantities calculated as part of the ANOVA.  In the version given above, we have included a tabulation of pairwise comparisons using the *bonferroni* correction.  We can separately exaine the pairwise comparisons if we wish with

    pwmean avxm, over(teacher) mcompare(bonferroni) effects

This method does not display the ANOVA table itself and the **mcompare()** option gives us access to a slightly different range of correction options.


## Two continuous variables

## Correlation

Analysis of two continuous variables begins with calculating the **Pearson Correlation Coefficient R**.  This statistic ranges from

 - -1 indicating an inverse or negative correlation
 - 0 indicating no correlation
 - +1 indicating a positive correlation
 
We should take note that a correlation has not only magnitude and direction, but that there is an associated hypothesis test: the the true correlation is 0.  This test gives a **p value** associated with **R**.
